Scientific Paper & CUDA Implementation Assistant
Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot with dual functionality:

Assists researchers in understanding and implementing ML/AI research papers
Provides guidance for CUDA implementation and optimization of ML/AI algorithms

The system helps bridge the gap between theoretical research and efficient GPU implementation by combining paper comprehension with CUDA expertise.
Features

Research Paper Processing:
Processes academic papers in PDF format, breaking them down into meaningful chunks while preserving mathematical notation and technical details.
CUDA Implementation Guidance:
Provides specific CUDA implementation strategies for ML/AI algorithms, drawing from NVIDIA's documentation and best practices.
Intelligent Summarization:
Offers concise summaries of research papers and maps theoretical concepts to practical CUDA implementations.
Text Chunking & Embedding:
Advanced embedding techniques to maintain context across both research papers and CUDA documentation.
Vector Search with FAISS:
Efficient similarity search to retrieve relevant content from both papers and CUDA guides.
LLM Integration:
Uses Hugging Face's FLAN-T5 model for generating contextually accurate responses.
